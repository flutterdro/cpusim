emulator of intel 8080 for learning purpose

Thanks to the dude from http://www.emulator101.com/ for the guide. 
I also used this thingy https://altairclone.com/downloads/manuals/8080%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf.

I am embarrassed by this piece of crap and do understand how much wrong I have done but I have no plans on rewriting it now
